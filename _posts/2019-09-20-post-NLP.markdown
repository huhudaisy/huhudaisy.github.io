## Automatic English fill-in system

In order to solve the problem of cloze filling, this paper completes the cleaning of text materials, uses word embedding to complete the encoding of words to numbers, and uses Tensorflow to build one-way LSTM. Using the normal-order text training model, get the forward LSTM model, then flip the text order and retrain to get the reverse LSTM model. The prediction probability of the integrated positive and negative LSTM model is the final word prediction result. In addition, an LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) is also used to obtain a code table of words, and the distance between the candidate word and the word in the question is calculated, and the distance is small as a prediction. Because it is not effective, it has not been adopted. The correct rate for the forward LSTM on the test set is 0.44, the reverse LSTM is 0.40, the bidirectional LSTM result is 0.49, and the LSA accuracy is 0.43. The final submitted version is a two-way LSTM.

The network structure is as follows:
