## Graduation project

Smart home can improve people's life quality in the home; the home gateway is the control and management center of the smart home. In order to resolve the differences in the protocols used by different vendors, the poor compatibility of the equipment and heterogeneous network problems, This paper uses the middleware technology to connect a variety of devices in smart home and puts forward the design of smart home gateway based on openHAB.The system uses raspberry 3B and Linux to build an embedded system platform. This paper completed the binding and configuration of WiFi, Bluetooth, weather and other functional components, writing home automation control rules and a variety of terminal user interface, using the RRD database to record environment parameters, using motion software to achieve camera video monitoring ,using openHAB cloud services to realize remote login.According to the test, the system can effectively support multiple protocols .The functions of remote login,  the database, and video cameras monitoring are normal.

Our physical objects are as follows, including Raspberry Pi, display, and IoT devices.
