## Graduation project —— Research on the catalytic type methane gas sensors based on CeO<sub>2</sub> supported Pd
A series of CeO<sub>2</sub> supported Pd catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation method, and the effects Pd amount on catalytic efficiency and stability of methane were investigated. The microstructures of the catalysts were characterized by XRD,TPR and SEM，and the catalytic mechanism of Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub> was proposed. There were two kinds of methane active sites on the surface of Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub>:Ce<sub>1-x</sub>Pd<sub>x</sub>O<sub>2-δ</sub> and PdO. A part of Pd was present in the form of highly dispersed surface PdO, and the other part of Pd<sup>2+</sup> was doped into CeO<sub>2</sub> unit to form Ce<sub>1-x</sub>Pd<sub>x</sub>O<sub>2-δ</sub> solid solution. The higher the activity of Ce<sub>1-x</sub>Pd<sub>x</sub>O<sub>2-δ</sub>, the better the catalytic efficiency at low temperature, the higher the Pd loading, the better stability at high temperature. Catalytic methane gas sensors were fabricated based on Pd/CeO<sub>2</sub> catalysts, and the sensor response and stability were studied.
